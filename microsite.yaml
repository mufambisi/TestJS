# Components document to the build pipeline what downstream builds need to be run.
# Each type will need to produce a correctly named artifact for the downstream jobs.
# These dependencies can be seen in the development and release pipelines in the ci-micro-site project.
# But they follow a naming convention of the following:
#   output/$componentType-$componentName[-infra].(zip|jar)
# Note: In theory you can have multiple components of the same type with different names, but this may not be fully tested.
Components:
  # Should produce the following artifacts:
  # output/tal-assets.zip
  assets:
    type: tal
